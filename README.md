# Hotel Management SQL Project

## Overview
This project involves managing hotel guest and booking information using a SQL database. The primary goal is to create a database schema that efficiently stores and retrieves data related to guests and their bookings, and to execute SQL queries to extract useful insights and perform necessary operations.

## Description
The project consists of two main tables: `Guests` and `Bookings`. The `Guests` table stores personal information about the guests, and the `Bookings` table stores information about the bookings made by these guests. Several SQL queries have been developed to perform various operations, such as inserting records, finding guest statistics, calculating financial metrics, and generating reports.

## Scope
1. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Create tables for guests and bookings.
   - Establish relationships between the tables.

2. **Data Insertion**:
   - Insert sample data into the `Guests` and `Bookings` tables.

3. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**:
   - Perform SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data.
   - Generate reports based on the data.

4. **Financial Calculations**:
   - Calculate total revenue.
   - Determine the average stay duration.
   - Identify top-spending guests.

5. **Guest and Booking Management**:
   - Identify guests with multiple bookings.
   - List guests based on various criteria.
   - Analyze guest stay patterns.

## Files
- `schema.sql`: Contains the SQL code to create the database schema.
- `data_insertion.sql`: Contains the SQL code to insert sample data into the tables.
- `queries.sql`: Contains various SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data from the database.
